                <h4>Resonation</h4>
                <p>
                    When individuals who are gainfully employed decide to renounce another corporation's business, to mind their Mind Their Own Business,they are actually creating an avenue(opportunities) for both underemployed and unemployed citizens. You leaving your job without the organization been in any financial crisis or operational difficulties(downsizing), another qualified graduate who is fit for the job will be able to occupy the available job space, thereby helping him or her get a life and an avenue to look ahead. Mathematically speaking, let's assume 5,000 Nigerians who are gainfully employed decide to renounce their jobs to build their prospective businesses(MYOB). They are not only providing another 5,000 NIgerians who are qualified for the job with opportunities, but also contributes to the development and the GDP of the nation. This will be evident in the light of the qualified graduates getting these jobs.

                <h3>Hypothetically speaking:--</h3>
                <p>
                    if 5,000 Nigerians eventually decide to 'MYOB', successfully conceptualize and give birth to their ideas by establishing a corporation. On subsequent operation, qualified manpower will be required for advancement. For a starter let's assume the manpower required falls at a minimum of ten feasible and viable personnel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Calculation
                </p>
                <p>
                    let's do the math:-- 5,000*10 = 50,000 Nigerians will be gainfully employed
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, if the business grow to employing thirty(30) man power necessary for enhancement. Calculation:-- 50,000*30 = 150,000 will be gainfully employed. Keeping up with the progress, if the company can actually afford a hundred(100)personnel.

                    I'm not oblivion to the fact that business ideas are really hard to come by(ignite) most especially in an economy like Nigeria, and also, to the fact that banks operation are not very encouraging in the aspect of the exhorbitant charges(cost of borrowing:-popularly known as interest rate) on loans aquired. But like seriously, some of us need to start crossing the line(taking bold steps), if not for anything, but for the development and growth of this generation and prospective generation. Some of us need to start taking risk, even though the chances of our businesses surviving are not guarnteed. It's true that failure is one of the greatest enemy of man, (note:--which is inevitable). At some point in time, a man is bound to fail at one thing or the other, be it MARRIAGE, BUSINESS, PARENTING, as a TEACHER etcetera, but how and when we fail shouldn't be our major concern (since it's inevitable), but strategic plans or counter measures put in place, which will help us get back on our feet, and fight back with great strenght.

Imagine an average(youth to be precise) Nigeria going about with the mentality that listening to radio stations or tuning to News Stations is a cultural way of life which is secluded(meant) for only adults, because of it's history. These are platforms where vital informations are disbursed everyday, which are very prominent for both successful businessmen and prospective business magnate. This is purely ignorance, which contributes largely, to an average man's failure.
